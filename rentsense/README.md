# This is the develop branch 
### For every feature we work on, we shall create a new feature branch, forking out from this branch by (git checkout -b ....) 
For example: While working on User registration,
git checkout develop
git checkout -b develop_user_registration_feature

### After we are sure that the feature branch is completed, we have to git pull for one last time to incorporate all the changes across various other features, resolving merge conflicts and then finally push the feature branch from the local repo
