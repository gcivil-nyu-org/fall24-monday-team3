<H1>User Personas</H1>


  <h2>Epics</h2>
  <p> There are 2 epics in the project</p>
  <li> Users</li>
  <li> Moderators</li>
  <h3> Users</h3>
  <p>In the application, users range from various backgrounds in real life such as first time renters who are interested in renting an entire apartment or sharing an apartment with other roommates or just interested in knowing more about the rental market in various neighborhoods in NYC. Users persona also encompasses the activities of the experienced Real Estate Investors and Brokers, who are interested in observing long term and short term trends in rental prices in the neighborhoods, in relation to the external circumstances and take informed decisions accordingly. All users, irrespective of their backgrounds, are treated as the same kind of entity. Users can estimate the fair range of rental prices for a property, given the parameters (Ex: area of the property, type of property, neighborhood etc.) using our ML model. Users also can post the property vacancies, partial vacancies and share the rent of their current property and discuss, thus resulting in increased transparency of the market.</p>
  <h3> Moderators</h3>
  <p> Moderators are managing entities or admins of the application, who authorize the users when they are registering them for the first time and moderate the content by checking the alignment with the purpose of thread. Moderators are responsible for collecting vacancies posted by users from the categories and threads of the application and perform efficient data analysis to give better understanding of the current market situation. Moderators also have access to voluntarily improve the efficiency of the price estimation module, by supplying additional datapoints found from anecdotes or other sources.
